# PacManProject
PacMan
Description of Project: When the user clicks on "Add Pacman" a pacman will be added to the screen. Once the user is content with the number of pacmans on their scrren
they can click "Start Game" and the pacmans will move around the screen!
How to Run: As mentioned in the description, the way to run this exercise is fairly simple. Use the "Add Pacman" button to add as many pacmans on the screen
as you would like. Then, click the "Start Game" button to get them moving!!!

Roadmap of future improvements: I think it would be a cool idea to get the Pacmans to make noise if they hit a wall.
License information: This program was created through the MIT xPro program with edits made by myself.
